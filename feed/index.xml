										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Flight operation in Nilphamari&#8217;s Saidpur Airport was suspended for three hours due to poor visibility caused by dense fog today. The airport officials said the situation returned to normal after 2:00pm, our Dinajpur correspondent reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suplob Kumar Ghosh, manager at the airport, said the visibility decreased in the area since late last night, and so the authorities decided to suspend landing and takeoff at the airport for three hours from 11:00am. As a result, three flights on the Dhaka-Saidpur route were delayed for two to three hours. The flight operations resumed after 2:00pm today when the weather situation improved, Manager Suplob said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A Sharjah-bound flight of Air Arabia had to return to Chattogram Shah Amanat International Airport two hours after take-off last night due to a technical glitch, said airport officials. The flight was yet to leave the port city nearly 22 hours after it had originally taken off, our local staff correspondent reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Group Captain Taslim Ahmad, director of Shah Amanat International Airport, told The Daily Star today that a technical team of Air Arabia was working on the issue, and hoped that the flight would leave after 6:00pm. Og the 149 passengers on board, around 90 are staying in hotels, some have changed their tickets while others returned home, he said around noon today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The flight landed safely around 9:35pm yesterday after it took off from the airport at 7:24pm, the director told The Daily Star yesterday. &#8220;The captain noticed the electrical problem after take-off and he turned the aircraft around from the Kolkata air border to Chattogram. &#8220;It was an emergency landing, and after the landing, we towed the aircraft from the runway,&#8221; he said, adding that measures were taken for the passengers&#8217; overnight accommodation and food.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Come February 2, 2024, Gulmarg, Kashmir, will be hosting the fourth edition of the much-awaited Khelo India Winter Games. If reports are to go by, all concerned departments are working to ensure all facilities meet international standards. As per the reports, the success of past editions has helped transform Jammu and Kashmir into a winter sports hub. Sports in India are more than cricket. And keeping this in mind, the Khelo India initiative was launched by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. Ever since its launch in 2021, Khelo India has been a game-changer, fostering a culture of sports and fitness across the country. While the summer edition of Khelo India has gained widespread recognition, the Winter Games component is slowly carving its niche, bringing forth not only the hidden talents in winter sports, but also the destinations associated with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Khelo India Winter Games focuses on sports like ice hockey, cross-country, skiing, and snowboarding. Interestingly, though the northern states like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand naturally have a stronghold in winter sports, several athletes from states that are not traditionally associated with cold weather sports have been making their mark. The Winter Games encompass a variety of disciplines. Ice hockey, cross-country, skiing and snowboarding in particular have been tremendously impressive. It’s not just sports enthusiasts, but travellers from all over India and abroad have made it to the games to witness the adrenaline-pumping sports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Khelo India Winter Games is also a great opportunity to showcase the rich culture and warm hospitality of the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. As per the Sports Authority of India (SAI), the 4th Edition of Khelo India Winter Games 2024 will be held from February 2 to 6, 2024, in two Union Territories of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Ladakh. The event will feature competitions across seven sports, and with participation from 860 athletes, in two venues – Gulmarg and Leh. At the moment, Gulmarg is experiencing a snowless winter which makes one wonder about the winter games. But one can still hope for the much-awaited (and timely) snow in Gulmarg for the exciting Khelo India Winter Games.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A groundbreaking discovery has been made in a deserted quarry near Cairo, New York, where researchers from the University of Binghamton in the US and the University of Cardiff in Wales have unearthed the planet&#8217;s most ancient forest. The fossils, embedded in rocks dating back a staggering 385 million years, provide a unique window into Earth&#8217;s distant past. It is estimated that the forest once covered an area of approximately 400 km. If reports are to go by, this forest predates the Amazon rainforest and Japan’s Yakushima Forest, which are some of the oldest forests in the world we know today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through several studies conducted by palaeobotanists on the petrified roots found embedded in the region’s rocks, it was declared that this is Earth&#8217;s oldest known forest. This incredible discovery unfolds the history of a time that existed long before human existence. Think of the time of dinosaurs when you think about this forest. Another thing about this forest that baffled researchers is the fact that, unlike their contemporary counterparts, the ancient trees of this forest didn’t propagate through the release of seeds. They in fact, relied on spores for reproduction. This unique characteristic adds a fascinating layer to our understanding of prehistoric ecosystems. It’s interesting to note that fungi share a similar method of reproduction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As researchers continue to delve into the secrets preserved in the rocks near Cairo, New York, this discovery promises to deepen our understanding of Earth&#8217;s early ecosystems, offering a glimpse into the fascinating world of ancient plants and the processes that shaped our planet over millions of years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other ancient woodlands that still exist are Daintree Rainforest in Australia that date back over 180 million years, Tasmania&#8217;s Tarkine Rainforest is over 65 million years old, Bialowieza Forest in Poland has been around for more than 8000 years, Sequoia National Park in the United States is home to the giant sequoia trees, some of which have stood for over 3,000 years. India’s Western Ghats ranges are also home to freshwater swamp forests that date back millions of years. It’s easy to fall in love with these ancient forests that not only capture the beauty of bygone eras but also serve as invaluable reservoirs of Earth’s history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In a remarkable discovery, scientists have unearthed a mysterious long-lost world that reportedly disappeared from Earth by a volcanic eruption approximately 22 million years ago. The rediscovery took place in the Panama Canal, where researchers from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute stumbled upon a lost forest on Barro Colorado Island, revealing that it harbours a species now absent from our planet. The vast mangrove forest at Barro Colorado Island, a peculiar find by the scientific team, offers a glimpse into a bygone era. This discovery will take you back to the Miocene Epoch, around 23 million years ago, when the South American and Caribbean plates collided, shaping the topography of present-day Panama and Central America.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following this geological collision, a gradual transformation occurred, leading from a mound to a hill, and eventually giving rise to an island in the vast oceanic expanse — Barro Colorado Island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Facebook Twitter Pinterest</strong><br />
Its periphery is dotted with towering trees, reaching impressive heights of up to 130 ft, forming a lush forest. Examinations of sedimentary samples from the island proved instrumental for the scientists. They found out that the area provided an ideal habitat for an ancient species of mangroves, excluding the presence of other tree varieties. The unique ecological system was the reason behind the forest&#8217;s origin in regions where fresh and marine water intermingled. Notably, during the Miocene Epoch, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration soared significantly higher than contemporary levels, estimated to be at least 500 ppmv (parts per million by volume), in contrast to today&#8217;s approximately 400 ppmv. This heightened concentration facilitated the growth of these ancient mangroves to towering dimensions unparalleled by their present-day counterparts.</p>

The team, delving into the scientific intricacies of their discovery, unearthed 121 preserved pieces of wood in a Barro Colorado Island stream. They christened this ancient mangrove species Sonneratioxylon barrocoloradoensis. The genus, Sonneratioxylon, pays homage to the existing group of species, while the latter part of the name acknowledges the island of its origin. Interestingly, although this mangrove species has distant relatives in contemporary Southeast Asia, the lack of other tree fossils near the island suggests the challenges other species faced in surviving there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>22-million-year-old lost forest resurfaces in Panama Canal!</strong><br />
Fossil evidence has offered an explanation of the mangrove forest&#8217;s disappearance, pointing to a volcanic eruption as the reason behind its extinction. This eruption triggered a ‘lahar,’ an Indonesian term referring to an aggressive flow of water, mud, rocks, and ash. Lahars, akin to a swift and expansive blanket of wet concrete, have a remarkable ability to cover large areas almost instantaneously. Their silica-rich waters, coupled with rapid flow, played a pivotal role in preserving fossils. The concrete-like blanket prevented decomposition, allowing the waters to seep into the tissues of living organisms and leaving plants and animals with no opportunity to rot. This rediscovered ancient world at Barro Colorado Island not only offers a glimpse into a prehistoric ecosystem, but also explains how the interplay of geological forces and catastrophic events have shaped Earth&#8217;s history.</p>
