										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A Sharjah-bound flight of Air Arabia had to return to Chattogram Shah Amanat International Airport two hours after take-off last night due to a technical glitch, said airport officials. The flight was yet to leave the port city nearly 22 hours after it had originally taken off, our local staff correspondent reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Group Captain Taslim Ahmad, director of Shah Amanat International Airport, told The Daily Star today that a technical team of Air Arabia was working on the issue, and hoped that the flight would leave after 6:00pm. Og the 149 passengers on board, around 90 are staying in hotels, some have changed their tickets while others returned home, he said around noon today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The flight landed safely around 9:35pm yesterday after it took off from the airport at 7:24pm, the director told The Daily Star yesterday. &#8220;The captain noticed the electrical problem after take-off and he turned the aircraft around from the Kolkata air border to Chattogram. &#8220;It was an emergency landing, and after the landing, we towed the aircraft from the runway,&#8221; he said, adding that measures were taken for the passengers&#8217; overnight accommodation and food.</p>
